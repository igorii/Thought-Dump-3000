                I'm a Computer Science student at Carleton University, with a speciality in Networking and a minor in Mathematics.

                Beyond that, I'm a programming enthusiast with oscillating passions:

                I am also an avid hobbyist, and routinely have a small set of personal projects on the go. At the time of this writing, my project is of course, this website. I find I gravitate towards Node.js for quick projects, as the time required to setup is relatively shorter than many of the alternatives I have tried.

                I also have a habit of exploring new languages. I often use the creation of this very website as a Hello World when learning new languages. This allows me to work in a domain I am familiar with while also providing the chance to contrast advantages and disadvantages between languages at this task. In this manner, I have explored Haskell, Scala, Erlang, and JavaScript.
